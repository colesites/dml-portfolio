/*
 * Text diff implementation.
 *
 * This library supports the following APIs:
 * Diff.diffChars: Character by character diff
 * Diff.diffWords: Word (as defined by \b regex) diff which ignores whitespace
 * Diff.diffLines: Line based diff
 *
 * Diff.diffCss: Diff targeted at CSS content
 *
 * These methods are based on the implementation proposed in
 * "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations" (Myers, 1986).
